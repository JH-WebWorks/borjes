# borjes

Borjes is a javascript library for unification based grammar parsing. It has not been tested with large-sized grammars, and is intended more as a demonstration and for educative purposes.

It runs in the server or in the browser, and supports some interesting features such as disjunctions and free-form (typeless) AVMs.

Borjes was developed as an engine for [BOLDE](https://github.com/agarsev/bolde). There is also library for visualization and editing of borjes objects using react: [borjes-react](https://github.com/agarsev/borjes-react).
